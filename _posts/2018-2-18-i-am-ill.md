### Oops it hit me

Yep, as the title may convey I got sick and had to stay in the bed and rest with a fever.

In js Terminology it would be something like that.

```javascript
import leobody;

var leo = leobody.beingSick();
while(leo){
  if (!leo.sleep()) {
      leo.eat();
      leo.drinks();
      leo.sleep();
  }
  leo.awake();  
}
```
